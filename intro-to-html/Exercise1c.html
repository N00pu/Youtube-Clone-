<p>Hello,World!</p>
<p>Today was fun. I woke up pretty early in the morning and had my cup of tea.
  After that did my regular exercise.Later I studied my HTML & CSS course.
  In the evening went for a lovely car drive with my Best friend.
  Took her to two new places and had lovely food in the evening.
  Drove her back home in the crazy rainy weather.
  And finally after safely dropping her, came back some smiling
  and remebering about the lovely moments we had during the drive back home.
